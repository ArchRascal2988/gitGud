## Product Description
The gitGud project is reaching out to people who are interested in learning about a particular game, genre of games, or gaming in general.  Users will have the ability to check out some of the hottest games, and learn from the greatest gamers out there.  Users will learn tid-bits from established gamers about some of their favorite games.  Don't show up to a game, not knowing how to play it, show up to the game gud.  


## How to Use the Project
The user opens the website with a form asking them what type of platform will they be playing the game.  Using information from "freetogame.com", the user can then select what genre of game they would like from the drop down menu; examples include, Battle Royale, MOBA and Strategy.  After the user makes a genre selection a list of top 10 games will show up.  Select the game you are interested in learning about and the top 5 streamers from Twitch.tv will show you how to play the game.  The user can then navigate to another game quickly with the form still available and the top 10 games listed.
